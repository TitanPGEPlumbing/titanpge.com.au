Plumber reserves the right to refuse any Order placed by the Client at any time through verbal, written, or digital notification, up until the end of business on the date that the Order is scheduled to be fulfilled.
<br>
<br>2. Any quotation provided by Plumber is based on the professional estimation of existing drainage, sewer pipes, water, or gas lines, and electrical cables. If it is discovered that the actual conditions differ from those estimated or if they are inaccessible or unusable in their present state, Plumber reserves the right to vary the quotation accordingly.
<br>
<br>3. Once an Order has been accepted by Plumber, the Client cannot cancel it without the express consent of Plumber. In cases where Plumber has already ordered goods from a third party, cancellation will only be possible if Plumber can return the goods to the third party at no loss to Plumber. If goods are unable to be returned and Plumber is unable to complete the Order due to the Client's actions and cancellation, the Client will be held liable for all costs of goods and services already ordered and/or supplied for the Order.
<br>
<br>4. Plumber reserves the right to cancel the supply of Goods or Services, or any part thereof, at any time after accepting an Order, and shall not be liable for any loss or damage suffered by the Client as a result of such cancellation.
<br>
<br>5. Any change or variation to the Goods or Services provided under the Order or any additional work conducted by Plumber will be charged at Plumber's standard rates and shown as variations in the Plumbers tax invoice.</p>

<br>
<br>2. The Client is responsible for ensuring that there is clear, safe, and adequate access to the area where the Goods are to be delivered and/or Services rendered. The Plumber will not be held liable for any loss or damage suffered by the Client or their property due to inadequate access. The Client will be responsible for any loss or damage suffered by the Plumber due to delays, whether known or unforeseen, and will be charged at the Plumber’s standard rates, which will be shown as variations in the Plumber’s tax invoice.
<br>
<br>3. The Plumber may deliver Goods or Services in instalments. If separate invoices are raised for each instalment, the Client must pay each invoice in accordance with the terms of this agreement and is not entitled to wait until all instalments have been supplied.
<br>
<br>4. While the Plumber will use their best efforts to supply Goods or Services in accordance with the quotation, the Plumber will not be held liable for any delay in the supply of the Goods or Services, regardless of the reason, including negligence by the Plumber.
<br>
<br>5. If the Client postpones the supply of Goods or Services, or if the delay is due to the Client's inaction, an additional fee may be charged by the Plumber. This fee will form part of the Price and will be charged at the Plumber’s standard rates, which will be shown as variations in the Plumber’s tax invoice.
<br>
<br>6. In the event that the Client has not fulfilled their Payment obligations, the Plumber reserves the right to recover Goods supplied by accessing the area where the Goods or Services were rendered, provided there is clear, safe, and adequate access. This action will be charged at the Plumber’s standard rates for recovery of Goods and will be shown as variations in the Plumber’s tax invoice. The Plumber will take care to minimize any disturbance or damage to surrounding areas, including walls, ceilings, floors, garden beds, and paint. Any repair or restoration required after the recovery of the Goods will not be covered by the Plumber and must be conducted at the Client's cost.
<br>
<br>7. If the Plumber is unable to recover the Goods supplied and installed at the Client’s address in a reasonable manner, the Plumber reserves the right to seek 3rd party action, legal counsel, or take other means to restrict or deny services to the Client until the outstanding Price has been settled.<br></p>

Blocked Drains: The Client acknowledges that the presence of plant root growth and blockages is often indicative of damaged pipes that may require repair or replacement. If the Client does not authorize the Plumber to conduct such repair or replacement work, the Plumber cannot guarantee that the same or similar problems will not recur. In the event that any of the Plumbers' equipment becomes lodged or is damaged while in the Client's pipes or drains, the Client agrees to pay the costs of removal of the equipment, including any necessary excavation and restoration work.
<br>
<br>2. Rock and Filled Ground: Unless otherwise agreed, the supply of Goods and Services does not include the excavation, relocation, repair, or removal of any rocks, surfaces, or other obstructions that may be necessary for the Plumber to supply the Goods or Services. The Plumber reserves the right to apply an additional fee, which will form part of the Price, and will be charged by the Plumber at their nominated rates, as shown on the Plumbers tax invoice.
<br>
<br>3. Restoration: The Plumber will take care when supplying the Goods or Services to minimize any disturbance or damage to surrounding areas, including walls, ceilings, floors, garden beds, and paint. Any repair or restorations required after the supply of the Goods or Services is not included in the Plumbers' quotation and must be conducted at the Client's cost.
<br>
<br>4. Leak Detection: Leak detection services are provided using audio and gas to pinpoint leaks. The services are most effective in quiet environments without any background noise from rain, wind, garden equipment, or traffic. If there is too much background noise or scheduled weather conditions, the Plumber may postpone the services. The gas used to pinpoint the leak works in copper and polyurethane pipes. Push-on fittings used in pipes may not be rated for gas and may affect the results.<br></p>
